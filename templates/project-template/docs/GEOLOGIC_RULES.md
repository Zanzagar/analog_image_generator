# Geologic Rules Index — Principle → Code Anchors (Template)

Purpose: Provide traceability from documented principles to concrete function anchors in `src/` and corresponding notebook anchors.

Usage:
- Keep entries short and specific. One principle per row.
- Code Anchor should match a function name present in code and notebooks.

Env | Principle | Code Anchor
--- | --- | ---
__ENV_NAME__ | __Principle__ | `__PACKAGE_NAME__.__module__.function(...)`
